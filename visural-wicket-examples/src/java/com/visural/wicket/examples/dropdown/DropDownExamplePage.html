                    The Drop Down component works like a standard "Combobox" control, or as a "suggestion" control. <br/><br/>
                    As a combobox, users can start typing and a matching list of records from the list will be displayed. Users may use the up and down arrow keys to select, or use the mouse to select an item form the list. In Combobox mode though, users must select a value. <br/><br/>
                    In "Suggestion" mode, the users may free-text type a value, or select a value using the same Combobox-like behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>The Combobox-mode uses the provided IModel (or backing CompoundPropertyModel) such that the value that is set is the list's Java object type itself.</p>
                <p>In suggestion-mode the string value of the control is set against the provided model, since the user may free-text enter a value.</p>
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>Drop Down Control Examples</legend>
                    <div class="fieldset"><label>Countries of the World:</label> <input type="text" wicket:id="basic"/></div>
                    <div class="fieldset"><label>&nbsp;</label>[Model value = '<span wicket:id="basicVal"></span>']<br/><br/></div>
                    <div class="fieldset"><label>Choose, or type your own:</label> <input type="text" wicket:id="freetext"/> </div>
                    <div class="fieldset"><label>&nbsp;</label>[Model value = '<span wicket:id="freetextVal"></span>']</div>
                </fieldset>
                <br/><br/>
                <a href="#" class="button" wicket:id="submit">Submit</a>
                <br/><br/>
                <p class="highlight">
                    Also notice, that if you view the code to this page (your browser's "View Page Source"),
                    that even though we have two DropDown components with a large list of countries, because
                    they share the same Data Source, the list of countries is only rendered into the mark-up once.</p>
                <p>
                    Thus if you have a lot of of Drop Down controls (e.g. edit-in-place child records) that use
                    the same data source, you're page size will be reduced significantly, versus using a standard HTML <b>select</b> component.
