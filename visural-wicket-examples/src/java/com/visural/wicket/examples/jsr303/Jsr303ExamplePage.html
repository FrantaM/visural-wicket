                JSR303 defines a way of validating Java Beans using annotations. While it is possible to create all business validations
                through use of JSR303's feature set, in practice the most useful annotations are the basic ones, for flagging
                nullability, character size, numeric bounds, past/future dates or ranges and specific things like valid email addresses.
            </p>
            <p>JSR303ValidatedForm allows you to implement these types of validations using JSR303 annotations on your form's model beans.</p>
            <p><b>Note</b> only the simple annotation types list above are picked up. visural-wicket takes a different tack to other integrations of JSR303, in that it applies standard Wicket validators based on the annotations on the model, rather than trying to apply JSR303 validation in place of Wicket's validation.</p>
            <p>The reason for this is that I think Wicket's validation is pretty solid and practical, and it doesn't make sense to throw away one of Wicket's best features for a different implemenation.</p>
            <p>This integration is more for Wicket developers who want a convenient and time-effecting syntax, rather than JSR303 users who want a simple Wicket experience.</p>
