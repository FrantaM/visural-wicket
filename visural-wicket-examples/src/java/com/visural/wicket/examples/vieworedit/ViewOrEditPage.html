                ViewOrEdit is a component which is invisible to the user, but makes development much easier. It allows form pages to automatically support multiple business rules where some components on the page are disabled under certain circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>The ViewOrEdit component "wraps" your regular form components, and based on the rule(s) that you determine chooses whether to present the editable component or a text-based read-only alternative.</p>
            <p>A stand-out feature of this component is that it creates a dynamic wrapping model, to allow you to still use CompoundPropertyModels applied to your Form or container, against your form components.</p>
            <p>Simply, wrap your control in the ViewOrEdit() component, give it the ID "ViewOrEdit.COMP_ID" and give your ViewOrEdit container, the ID that you would have given the form component.</p>
