            <h2>What is visural-wicket?</h2>
            <p>visural-wicket is a collection of Apache Wicket components and utilities. They are designed to be light-weight, loosely coupled and to be easily integrated into any existing Wicket application with minimal dependencies.</p>
            <p>Each component is also designed to be easily customised to fit a particular system's requirements.</p>
            <p>Other than components, visural-wicket includes some other utilities that assist in the development of Wicket applications, such as an annotation-based mounting system, model templates and automatic "form view mode" component.</p>
            <h2>How does visural-wicket differ from other libraries?</h2>
            <p>How does it differ from libraries such as WiQuery or wicket-stuff? A core goal of this project is to provide components which do not come with a lot of dependencies. Something like WiQuery / JQuery UI are fine if you plan to use all of those components heavily, but many designers wish to pick and choose their tools and a mixture of custom and off the shelf tools for a more customised look and feel.</p>
            <p>While visural-wicket uses JQuery (regular, not JQuery UI) for many of the components, as much as possible we've tried to keep the dependencies to a minimum, and clearly state them in the documentation. </p>
            <h2>Are they production-ready?</h2>
            <p>The visural-wicket and visural-common libraries can be seen in production use at Visural's site <a class="button" href="http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/" title="Upcoming events and local questions in Australia">On My Doorstep</a>. They have also been implemented in many other projects.</p>
            <p>The 0.6 release has proven very popular with 100's of downloads and good feedback indicating widespread use in the Wicket community.</p>
