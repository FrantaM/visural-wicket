            <p class="highlight">The "submitters" package contains both SubmitLink and Link replacements which can be used to indicate server-side processing to a user.</p>
            <p>There are two types of indicators; one that is modal, and one that isn't.</p>
            <p>The example below is a simple calculator that multiplies the two numbers. <span class="highlight">On the server side a 3 second delay to the calculation has been added so that you can observe the indicator behaviour.</span></p>
            <p>The first line of submit buttons is the "Indicate" type. They provide a list of page components that will be replaced by an indicator during form processing. This is similar to when you flag components for refresh during an AJAX call. <span class="highlight">The second indicator button (randomize) shows an example of using the indicator for multiple page components.</span></p>
            <p>The second line with the submit button is an example of a modal submitter. This is a modal box that appears over the page content and let's the user know that processing is happening. It also prevents the user from clicking any other buttons or change any form values.</p>
            <p>Both of these types of components are customisable (as to the displayed messages / images / text), and come in SubmitLink and Link flavours.</p>
