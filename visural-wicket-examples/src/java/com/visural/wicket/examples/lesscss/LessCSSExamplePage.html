                LessCSS extends CSS with variables, mixins, operations and nested rules.
            </p>
            <p>You can find out more about LessCSS at <a href="http://lesscss.org/">http://lesscss.org/</a></p>
            <p>LessCSS removes repetition from your stylesheets, and allows you to do complex cross-browser styling in one-line of code, using operations and nested rules.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>You can include LessCSS support in your Wicket application using visural-wicket by adding this line to your Application.init()</p>
            <pre>getResourceSettings().setResourceStreamLocator(new LessCSSResourceStreamLocator(getResourceFinder()));</pre>
            <p>Then whenever you reference a file ending in ".less", it will automatically get parsed and translated by the LessCSS compiler.</p>
            <pre>add(new StyleSheetReference("stylesheet", BasePage.class, "style.less"));</pre>
            <p>This example application uses a "LessCSS" stylesheet, so download it and take a look to get started!</p>
