                Dialog is a modal pop-up dialog which can be used as a container for any other wicket components.
            </p>
            <p>It can be opened and closed by either a server side AjaxRequestTarget, or on the client side by using an "onclick" javascript event.</p>
            <p>You can override the open and close javascript code to embed other javascript call backs if you desire.</p>
            <p>You can also switch on a feature which allows the dialog to close when you click on the background.</p>
